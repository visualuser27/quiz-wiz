        <h1>AI/ML Quiz: Correct Answers and Explanations</h1>
        
        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>1. What does the term "Machine Learning" refer to?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Data-driven learning</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Machine learning refers to algorithms that learn from data to improve their performance without explicit programming. It primarily relies on data to make predictions or decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>2. Which of the following is a supervised learning algorithm?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Linear Regression</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>3. What is the main idea behind "Supervised Learning"?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Learning from labeled data</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps input data to the correct output, based on labeled training data. The algorithm is "supervised" by these labels during training.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>4. Which library is commonly used for deep learning in Python?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> TensorFlow</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> TensorFlow is an open-source library for numerical computation that is widely used for deep learning applications. It provides tools for building and training neural networks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>5. Which of the following is an example of unsupervised learning?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> K-means Clustering</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering, where data is grouped based on similarities without labeled outputs. It creates 'K' clusters based on the data features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>6. What does the acronym "AI" stand for?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Artificial Intelligence</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> AI refers to Artificial Intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>7. What is the purpose of "Cross-validation" in machine learning?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To evaluate model performance on unseen data</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how well a machine learning model will generalize to new, unseen data. It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets and training/testing the model on these subsets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>8. Which type of neural network is commonly used for image classification?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> CNNs are specialized deep learning architectures designed to process data with grid-like topology, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically extract features from images for classification tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>9. Which of the following is a common evaluation metric for classification problems?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Accuracy</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. It is widely used to measure the performance of classification models.</p>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <p><strong>10. Which type of machine learning algorithm is used for spam detection?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Supervised Learning</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Spam detection is a classification problem where emails are labeled as "spam" or "not spam." Supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees and support vector machines, are commonly used for this type of task.</p>
